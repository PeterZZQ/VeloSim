Description: This package simulates single cell RNA sequencing data during cell developmental process, the simulation includes unspliced RNA count, spliced RNA count, RNA velocity and cell developmental pseudo-time. The simulation can be used to benchmark computational methods including trajectory inference and RNA velocity inference.
